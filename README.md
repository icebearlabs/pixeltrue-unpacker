# Pixeltrue Folder Unpacker

The default file structure for Pixeltrue's downloads from Gumroad is not really convenient for finding a picture.

So I wrote this script, so you can get ALL pngs in one folder and ALL svgs in one folder.

That way, you can check out the pngs and then find the matching svg afterwards.

Have fun.
